# opp_in_python_corey_schafer

- Object Oriented Programming (OPP) is an important element of any programming language. It helps in modularity and code reusability. 
- PyTorch provides the elegantly designed modules and classes, including torch.nn , to help one create and train neural networks.
- While playing around with Pytorch, I struggled to grasp few of the OPP concepts that a user must know to intuitively build neural networks.
- Given this gap and the desire to build a strong foundation in Python, I started to learn OPP using [Corey Schafer's](https://github.com/CoreyMSchafers) online tuotrials for OPP in Python
- So, this repo reflects the lecture material included in Corey's lectures on OPP in Python
